This order prevents parameter conflicts. Applying creative presets before technical corrections can lead to unpredictable results, as color grading interacts with white balance, and exposure adjustments affect contrast curves.

### Category Breakdown

**00 — Foundation (3 presets)**
Universal AUTO lens correction. Three tiers: full correction with chromatic aberration removal, minimal correction preserving natural vignette, and chromatic aberration removal only.

**01 — White Balance (6 presets)**
Neutral reset plus warm/cool shifts and dedicated tungsten and fluorescent fixes. These set the color foundation before any creative adjustments.

**02 — Exposure Recovery (5 presets)**
Problem-solving presets for under/overexposed images, blown highlights, and crushed shadows. Designed to rescue difficult exposures without introducing artifacts.

**03 — Lighting Fixes (4 presets)**
Situation-specific enhancements: bright sun protection, overcast contrast boost, golden hour warmth, and blue hour depth. Each targets the common problems of its lighting scenario.

**04 — Film Simulations (4 presets)**
Classic color film emulations with trademark-safe naming. Covers the major aesthetic families: muted/reportage, warm portrait, vivid landscape, and balanced natural.

**05 — Professional Styles (11 presets)**
The creative core — all major 2025-2026 trending looks. Wedding/portrait (Creamy Moody, Light & Airy, Soft Pastel), Instagram/influencer (Matte Vintage, Matte Modern, Golden Hour Honey, Clean & Bright), and editorial (Editorial Bold, Dark & Moody, Warm Earth Tones).

**06 — B&W Film Simulations (7 presets)**
Monochrome aesthetics ranging from high-contrast street (400-speed) to ultra-fine grain landscape (50-speed) to gritty push-processed drama (3200-speed).

**07 — Sharpening (6 presets)**
Output sharpening calibrated for different use cases: subtle (web), standard (general), strong (landscapes), portraits (edge-masked), high-resolution sensors, and APS-C sensors.

**08 — Noise Reduction (3 presets)**
ISO-tiered noise cleanup: light (800-1600), medium (1600-3200), heavy (3200-6400). Balanced to preserve detail while reducing luminance and color noise.
